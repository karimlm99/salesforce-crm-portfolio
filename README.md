# Salesforce CRM Portfolio — Lead to Opportunity

A portfolio-ready CRM built in a Trailhead Playground.

## Problem
Leads scattered in spreadsheets, missed follow-ups, and no pipeline visibility.

## Solution
- Standard objects (Lead, Account, Contact, Opportunity)
- Optional custom object `Customer_Interaction__c`
- Record-Triggered Flows for lead assignment & stage tasks
- Validation rules and executive dashboard

## Impact Targets
- Lead response time: 36h → 14h (‑61%)
- Lead→Opp conversion: 22% → 35% (+13 pp)
- Manual task creation: ~70% reduction

## Docs & Data
- [Business Scenario](./docs/BusinessScenario.md)
- [Build Guide](./docs/BuildGuide.md)
- Sample data in `/data` (CSV) for imports

## Screenshots
